To utilize the provided code base effectively within a GPT-4 framework, follow these structured instructions covering various aspects such as environment setup, usage of individual scripts, and integrating these components into a cohesive system. This guide assumes the context of a Walmart API interaction and Kafka messaging for a repricing system.

1. Environment Setup
Node.js and npm: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. Use the latest LTS version for stability.
Environment Variables: Set up environment variables for sensitive information like Walmart API credentials (WALMART_CLIENT_ID, WALMART_CLIENT_SECRET), MongoDB URI (MONGODB_URI), and Kafka broker addresses. Use a .env file and dotenv package for managing these variables in your Node.js application.
Dependencies: Install necessary npm packages (axios, mongodb, kafkajs, dotenv, cron) by running npm install axios mongodb kafkajs dotenv cron.
2. Authentication
Use auth.js to authenticate with the Walmart API. It handles token generation and renewal, ensuring all subsequent API calls are authenticated.
Before making API calls, invoke authenticateWalmartApi() to get a valid access token.
3. Fetching and Storing Item Data
fetchAndStoreItems.js fetches item data from Walmart API and stores it in MongoDB.
Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible through the URI specified in your environment variables.
Use this script to populate your database with initial item data or update it periodically.
4. Kafka Consumers for Price Analysis and Affiliate Price Queries
Price Analysis: priceAnalysisConsumer.js listens for messages on the price-analysis Kafka topic, fetches competitor data, and decides on price adjustments. It requires a Kafka broker setup and a topic created for price analysis messages.
Affiliate Price Queries: affiliatePriceQueryConsumer.js listens for messages on the affiliate-price-query topic, fetches and updates competitor prices and shipping rates. This consumer supports affiliate marketing strategies by ensuring competitive pricing.
5. Scheduled Tasks
Use schedulePriceUpdates.js for scheduling regular price updates. It uses the cron npm package to run price checks and updates at specified intervals. Customize the cron schedule according to your needs.
6. Competitor Price Fetching and Updating
fetchCompetitorPrices.js is used within Kafka consumers to fetch competitor prices from Walmart API and update your database accordingly.
7. Database Initialization and Maintenance
dbInit.js helps in setting up your MongoDB database with necessary indexes and structures for efficient querying and updates.
8. Writing Custom Scripts and Integrations
Custom Logic for Price Calculation: Implement your business logic in pricing.js for deciding new prices based on competitor data.
Integrating New Features: For additional features like reporting, analytics, or integrations with other services (e.g., email notifications), extend the code base by following Node.js and npm best practices.
9. Running the System
Start your MongoDB instance and ensure it's accessible.
Run Kafka and create necessary topics if not already set up.
Start your consumer scripts (priceAnalysisConsumer.js and affiliatePriceQueryConsumer.js) in separate terminal windows or as background processes.
Schedule or manually run fetchAndStoreItems.js to keep your item database up to date.
Regularly check logs for errors or issues, especially after deploying new code or updates.
10. Monitoring and Maintenance
Monitor your application for errors and performance issues.
Keep dependencies up to date with npm update.
Consider setting up logging, alerting, and monitoring tools to keep track of system health and performance.
This guide outlines a comprehensive approach to using the provided Node.js scripts for interacting with the Walmart API, managing item data, and performing price analysis through Kafka. Adjust and extend based on your specific requirements and infrastructure setup.
