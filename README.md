### Granular List of Scripting Tasks

#### Backend (`/api`)

1. **Configure Database for Multi-Tenancy (`/config/db.ts`):**
   - Script dynamic database/schema selection based on tenant ID.

   - Implement producer and consumer scripts for handling real-time pricing updates and competitor data.

3. **Implement Authentication Middleware (`/middleware/auth.ts`):**
   - Update authentication middleware to support multi-tenant user verification.

4. **Develop Tenant Resolver Middleware (`/middleware/tenantResolver.ts`):**
   - Create middleware to extract tenant ID from requests and set the context for subsequent operations.

5. **Define Models for Core Entities (`/models`):**
   - Create or update models to include a `tenantId` attribute where necessary.

6. **Create Controllers for Business Logic (`/controllers`):**
   - Implement controllers for handling user, product, subscription, and tenant-related operations.

7. **Set Up Routes (`/routes`):**
   - Define RESTful routes for the application, ensuring they are tenant-aware.

8. **Utility Scripts (`/utils`):**
   - Develop utility scripts for common operations like error handling and tenant validation.

9. **Initialize Server (`server.ts`):**
   - Set up Express server, integrating middleware, routes, and database connection.

#### Frontend (`/src`)

1. **Layout Components (`/components/layout`):**
   - Design header and footer components that adapt based on tenant-specific customization.

2. **Common Components (`/components/common`):**
   - Implement notifier and confirmer components for user feedback.

3. **Reactive Hooks (`/hooks`):**

### Scripting Wise To-Dos

- **Database Configuration:**
  - Implement logic in `db.ts` to connect to the appropriate database or schema based on the tenant.
  
- **Tenant Management:**
  - Script in `tenantController.ts` for CRUD operations on tenants.
  
- **User Authentication:**
  - Update `userController.ts` to handle multi-tenant user authentication and registration.
  
- **Subscription Handling:**
  - Implement subscription logic in `subscriptionController.ts` to manage subscription tiers and statuses per tenant.
  
- **Pricing Strategy Logic:**
  - Develop complex pricing strategies in `pricingController.ts`, allowing for tenant-specific rules and competitor analysis.
  
- **Frontend Customization:**
  - Utilize `theme.ts` and tenant-specific settings to allow dynamic UI customization.

- **API Integration:**
  - Ensure all frontend requests in `lib/api.ts` include tenant identification.

This structured approach, with clear scripting tasks, will facilitate the development of a robust, scalable multi-tenant SaaS repricer platform, ensuring comprehensive functionality and adherence to modern software architecture principles.

 integrates with the Walmart Affiliate API for competitor data and the Walmart Seller API for authentication and seller-specific operations. MongoDB serves as the persistence layer, storing fetched data for analysis.

Kafka is used as the messaging backbone to decouple data fetching from data processing and storage. This architecture choice enhances scalability, fault tolerance, and the ability to handle high volumes of data efficiently.

### Why Kafka?

- **Scalability**: Kafka's distributed nature allows the application to handle high volumes of messages (API responses, in this case) without a bottleneck, scaling horizontally as load increases.
- **Reliability**: Kafka guarantees delivery of messages, ensuring that even if a consumer fails, no data is lost. This is crucial for maintaining accurate and up-to-date competitor information.
- **Decoupling**: By using Kafka topics to separate concerns (e.g., fetching data from APIs, processing data, storing data in MongoDB), we enhance the application's maintainability and flexibility. It allows for individual components to be updated or replaced without impacting the entire system.

## Kafka Integration Details

### Setup and Configuration

1. **Kafka Cluster**: Begin by setting up a Kafka cluster. You can use Confluent Cloud for a managed service or deploy Kafka on your infrastructure.

2. **Topics Creation**: Create separate topics for each type of data or event you plan to handle. For example:
   - `walmart-competitor-data`: For messages containing raw data fetched from the Walmart Affiliate API.
   - `walmart-data-processing`: For messages indicating data ready for processing or analysis.

3. **Producers**: Implement producers in the part of your application that fetches data from Walmart APIs. These producers send messages to Kafka topics whenever new data is fetched.

   Example snippet for sending a message to Kafka after fetching data:
   ```javascript
   const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');

   const kafka = new Kafka({ brokers: ['your_broker_address'] });
   const producer = kafka.producer();

   await producer.connect();
   await producer.send({
     topic: 'walmart-competitor-data',
     messages: [{ value: JSON.stringify(competitorData) }],
   });
   ```

4. **Consumers**: Implement consumers to subscribe to Kafka topics and process messages accordingly. For instance, a consumer subscribed to `walmart-competitor-data` might parse the data and store it in MongoDB.

   Example snippet for consuming messages:
   ```javascript
   const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'my-group' });

   await consumer.connect();
   await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'walmart-competitor-data', fromBeginning: true });

   await consumer.run({
     eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
       const competitorData = JSON.parse(message.value.toString());
       // Process and store in MongoDB
     },
   });
   ```

### Usage Scenarios

- **Real-time Data Processing**: Kafka enables the application to process competitor data in real-time. As soon as new data is fetched and sent to a Kafka topic, it can be consumed and stored or analyzed without delay.
- **Load Balancing**: Kafka's consumer groups allow for load balancing of data processing across multiple instances of the application, enhancing performance and reliability.
- **Event Sourcing**: Kafka can serve as an event store, recording every change or fetched data point as an immutable event. This is beneficial for auditing, historical analysis, or rebuilding application state.

## Security Considerations for Kafka

- **Encryption**: Use TLS to encrypt data in transit between your application components and Kafka.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement SASL/SCRAM or TLS client authentication for clients connecting to Kafka and configure ACLs to control access to topics.
- **Network Isolation**: Deploy Kafka within a secure network (VPC) and limit access to known clients and services.
